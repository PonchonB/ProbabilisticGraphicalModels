# ProbabilisticGraphicalModels
This repository contains my work for the course Probabilistic Graphical Models I followed within the Master MVA-Mathematics (Computer) Vision and Learning at ENS Paris-Saclay in 2017/2018.
This course was taught by Guillaume Obozinski and Francis Bach.

The work I had to provide within this class was composed of three assignments and one paper review.
